# Tensors.jl

*Efficient computations with symmetric and non-symmetric tensors with support for automatic differentiation.*



## Introduction

This Julia package provides fast operations with symmetric and non-symmetric tensors of order 1, 2 and 4.


## Installation

The package can be installed with the Julia package manager.
From the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the Pkg REPL mode and run:

```
pkg> add Tensors
```

Or, equivalently, via the `Pkg` API:

```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("Tensors")
```
